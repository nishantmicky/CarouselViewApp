# Carousel View
A carousel view with pagination and have smooth scrolling using SwiftUI.

- When we drag the view the images will move along and image in center will zoom as it comes to center.
- When we lift finger while dragging, it should center to nearest image.
- The default height of carousel view is 250 and images have 1:1 aspect ratio.
- When any fixed height views is added at top or bottom, the carousel view will resize itself.
- The carousel view is easily extensible, currently only 3 images is added but you can add more images in less time.
